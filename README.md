# Mobile-App-For-Lottery-Addiction

#### **Context:**

Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some, this activity may escalate into habit and addiction that usually result into accumulating debt and eventually resort to more desperate behaviors like theft.  
A medical institute works in a project in which it wants to be assisted in the development of a mobile app intended to guide lottery addicts through exercices that will let them better estimate their chances of winning, and help them realize that buying too many tickets will do little to improve their chances of winning. 

#### **Goal:**

For the first version of the app, the institute wants us to focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that can answer users questions like:  

- What's the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?  
- what's the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?   
- What's the probability of having at least five(or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?  

The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to build the logic behind the app and calculate probabilities.  

#### **Dataset:**

The dataset has 3,665 data drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018. The 6/49 lottery is one of the first lotteries game to allow players to pick their own numbers.
